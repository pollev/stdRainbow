# stdRainbow
Fun little script that turns stdIn to a rainbow colored stdOut

This childish little script allows you to pipe output from other commands or programs to it. 
It will color the input in a rainbow and output it to the terminal.

NOTE: Because this wraps each character inside a bash escape character this will produce a significant slowdown and will cause problems when printing other escape characters.
